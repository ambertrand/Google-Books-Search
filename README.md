## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with creating a full MERN application using a Google Books API to search for books in the Google library. After looking back at the activities from the previous week I was able to create alot of the files needed based on the structure that they had set up in an activity.  Overall the project was not super difficult and feel like I am starting to grasp React a lot better.
